This directory contains a set of test models for HSF-SPIN. Most of them have been taken from the database of promela models available at

http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~lafuente/models/models.html.

We would like to thank the authors of the models for their contribution.

Some of the models have been modified, for example, in order to seed errors. Many of the models are parametrizable. Parameters have been named N and M (no model requires more than two parameters). For example, if you wish to generate a verifier for a configuration deadlock version of the giop protocol with 2 users and 1 client you would type: hsf-spin -a -DN=2 -DM=3 models/deadlock.giop.prm.

The prefix of the files indicate the type of error present in the model. Following errors prefixes are used:
 	- deadlock: Presence of deadlock states.
	- assertion: violation of an assertion.
	- endstate: Presence of valid endstates.
	- ltl.invariant: Violation of an invariant.
	- ltl : Visolation of an ltl formula.
